## description - 
In this Weather Dashboard repo I was tasked with creating an application dashboard from scratch through the OpenWeather API. Doing this and holding values with localstorage to see old city names searched, as well as allowing 2 API calls at once. Seeing the current forecast for the city searched and also seeing a weekly forecast for that city below.
