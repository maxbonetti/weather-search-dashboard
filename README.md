# weather-search-dashboard
A weather application for when a user travels to a city they are able to see the days forecast as well as the 5 day forecast. leaving last searched citys to local storage for fast "click" search

## Description 
In this Weather Dashboard repo I was tasked with creating an application dashboard from scratch through the OpenWeather API. Doing this and holding values with localstorage to see old city names searched, as well as allowing 2 API calls at once. Seeing the current forecast for the city searched and also seeing a weekly forecast for that city below.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Search**: Search for and display real-time weather conditions of any city.
- **Weekly Forecast**: View a 5-day weather forecast that updates dynamically.
- **Persistent Search History**: Utilizes `localStorage` to remember your past searches and allows quick reaccess to previously searched cities.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
